Group 5 reviewing Group 6
IMU Schematic
● Do the pads have an extra 1mm on them to make it easier to solder?
● What are ports 9,10, 11, 12, and 13 connected to?
Quadcopter Schematic
● Your voltage regulator (748421245) has two OUT ports and two GND ports whereas the
datasheet only shows one of each
● You don’t have a second FTDI header as mentioned in the lab 4 writeup
Motor Driver Schematic
● Where is the 10K resistor and 1uF capacitor that is a part of the filter in the motor driver?
● Where is the Schottky diode in the motor driver?
● Why is there a 100nF and a 4.7uF capacitor when the schematic for the motor driver
shows just a polar 100uF capacitor needed?
Quadcopter Board
● The board is not wired yet, when will this be done?
● Would like to know the dimensions
● Why are the LEDs not placed?
Meeting time: 1:50 in the envision lab
